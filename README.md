Arcanum
=======

Arcanum is an LDAP-based password management solution catering for the needs of both users and administrators.

It requires an LDAP server such as OpenLDAP. It mainly consists of a web application written in PHP.
Optionally an enhanced version of the login server JA-SIG CAS can be used, which will enhance the
web login experience.
